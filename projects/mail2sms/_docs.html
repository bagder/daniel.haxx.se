TITLE(mail2sms - documentation)
<p>
 There is some docs written. It isn't quite as good as it ought to be, but it
 is still better than nothing.
<p>
 Start off with the <a href="readme.shtml">README</a> that includes full
 details on how to write a syntacticly correct config file.
<p>
 When you think you're starting to understand some of it, try the <a
 href="example.shtml">example config file</a> and see how some easy things are
 done.
<p>
 For those weak-hearted who thinks regexes are tricky, I have this <a
 href="regex.shtml">regex guide</a> that explains some of the weird letter
 combinations you might wanna use!
<p>
 To figure out the command line options to mail2sms, have a look at the <a
 href="manpage.html">web version of the man page</a>.
<p>
 For detailed information about what has changed between versions and
 releases, have peek in the <a href="changes.shtml">CHANGES</a> file...
