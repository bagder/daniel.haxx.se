TITLE(mail2sms)
<p>
  <b>mail2sms</b> converts a single (large) mail to a tiny text with contents
  from the mail. Perfectly suitable to send as an SMS message to a GSM
  telephone.
<p>
  This program acts as a filter and can optionally run another program and
  pass the filtered data into it.
<p>
  This program features:
<ul> <i>
  regex search/replace, abort on regexes, conditional regex rules,
  conditional output, conditional whatever actually ;-), change output length,
  control output format, full MIME mail support (including
  multipart/alternative), conditional runs dependent on date/time, 
  splitting up the output in multiple output parts and more!
</i></ul>
<p>
  This program can not actually send any SMS by itself.

  <a href="mail2sms-1.3.5.tar.gz">Version 1.3.5</a>. Security fix. If you use
  'run' with $message in your mail2sms config, you should upgrade to 1.3.5

  I put mail2sms 1.2 up on the web. The 1.1 really didn't work well. I'll wait

TITLE(Support scripts)
<p>
  Several people asked me for a script to use for a mail-direct-to-any-phone
  mail alias, so now when I rewrote one, I decided to put it here:
<ul>
  <a href="smsmail.txt">smsmail.pl</a> - you better read the perl source and
  modify some of the defaults and addresses to suit your own environment!
</ul>
