Things to add in future incarnations of mail2sms:

* Make the 'run' parameter feature more replacement $variables, like all those
  available to the 'output' parameter!

* Hermann Himmelbauer: When I receive serveral SMS, the newest SMS is
  displayed first in my mobile phone (Siemens S35) - so if a mail is seperated
  in many parts, the last part is displayed first; What do you think of making
  an option like "reverse_ordering" that sends the last part first and the
  first part last to simplify reading the Mail on certain mobile phones?
 
 - free() all the malloc()ed memory

 - make checks for and prevent buffer overflows all over

 - Make the mail2sms.4 man page complete, use the README file as input.
