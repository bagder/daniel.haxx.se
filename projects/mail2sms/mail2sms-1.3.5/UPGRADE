The ABORT keyword is not working as it previously did! When you in older
versions did something like:

        abort: no.*sms

... in mail2sms 1.1 and onwards, you'll have to use the abort keyword within
an if/endif section, as in:

        if: no.*sms
          abort: no sms he said
        endif

Your mail2sms will not die if the old style us used, but it won't abort as you
would want it to!
