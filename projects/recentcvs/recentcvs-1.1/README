Date:    Feb, 2005
Licens:  This software is under an MIT-like license, see the COPYING file

PURPOSE
-------
1. Get the "recent" CVS commits presented in a nice HTML table

2. Produce a nice ASCII file with all changes the last 24 hours. Suitable
   for daily builds etc.

REQUIREMENTS
------------
Software used where this has proved to work:

 o cvs 1.11.1p1
 o perl 5.6

Feel free to try other versions.

STATUS
------
This has only been in used in the Rockbox project using a sourceforge CVS
repository, why things are a bit "hard-coded" in the scripts.

CRONTAB
-------
[this is an example crontab line]
# this makes the HTML table
00,20,40 * * * * cd [dir]; ./last5commits.pl | ./cvslast5.pl > cvstable.html
# this generates the daily changes-file
0 0 * * * cd [dir]; ./dailylog.pl


IMPROVEMENTS
------------
If you make improvements to these scripts that you believe others might enjoy,
please mail me diffs and I'll make sure to include those changes in future
releases.
