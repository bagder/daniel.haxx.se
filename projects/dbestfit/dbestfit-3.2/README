Package: dbestfit - a dynamic memory allocator

 I wrote the dmalloc part for small allocation sizes to improve the behavior
of the built-in (first-fit) allocator found in pSOS.

 I wrote the bmalloc part (best-fit with splay-tree sorting) just for the fun
of it and to see how good malloc() clone I could make. The quality of my
implementation is still left to be judged in real-world tests.

TODO:
 * Remove the final not-so-very-nice loop in dmalloc.c that checks for a block
   with free fragments (when the list gets longer too much time might be spent
   in that loop).

 * Add semaphore protection in bmalloc.

 * Make a separate application that samples the memory usage of a program
   and is capable of replaying it (in order to test properly).
