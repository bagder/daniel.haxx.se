<li> Fixed space flag for floating-point numbers (reported by Ian Main).
</ul>
<p><b>1.8</b><ul>
<li> Fixed infinite loop in multibyte handling (reported by Gisli Ottarsson).
<li> Added the customizable cprintf/cscanf family which enables to user to specify

<p><b>1.6</b><ul>
<li> Added dynamic string functions.
<li> Rewrote and extended documentation in JavaDoc (using Doxygen).
<li> Moved and renamed strio functions to triostr.
<li> Robert Collins
  Added definition for Cygwin.
<li> Markus Henke
  Added long double workaround for the HP C/iX compiler.
<li> Marc Verwerft
  Improved error handling for dynamically allocated strings.
<li> John Fotheringham
  Made trionan compile on OpenVMS.
<li> Added 'd' and 'D' as exponent letters when using TRIO_MICROSOFT.
<li> Fixed uninitial memory read for the parameter modifiers.
</ul>
<p><b>1.5</b><ul>
<li> Merged with libxml changes
<li> Moved NaN and Inf handling to separate file to enable reuse in other
  projects.
<li> Fixed TrioGenerateNan for MSVC.
<li> Fixed lots of preprocessor macros and internal data structure names.
</ul>
<p><b>1.4</b><ul>
<li> Added hex-float (%a and %A) for scanning.
<li> Added wide character arguments (%ls, %ws, %S, %lc, %wc, and %C) for both
  printf and scanf.
<li> Added mutex callbacks for user-specified specifiers to enable applications to
  add thread-safety. These are registered with trio_register, where the
  namespace is set to either ":enter" to lock a mutex, or ":leave" to unlock a
  mutex.
<li> Added equivalence class expressions for scanning. For example, %[[=a=]] scans
  for all letters in the same equivalence class as the letter 'a' as defined
  by the locale.
<li> Changed character class expressions for scanning. The expressions must now
  be embedded withing an extra set of brackets, e.g. %[[:alpha:]]. This was
  done to adhere to the syntax of UNIX98 regular expressions.
<li> Added the possibility to specify standard support (TRIO_C99 etc.) as compiler
  options.
<li> Fixed conversion of hex-float in StrToDouble.
<li> Fixed formatting of hex-float numbers.
<li> Fixed crash on QNX, which happend because some buffers on the stack were too
  big.
<li> Fixed default precision for %f and %g (reported by Jose Ortiz)
<li> Added the I8, I16, I32, and I64 modifiers.
<li> Fixed rounding problem for %e.
<li> Fixed various problems with the xlC and Sun C++ compilers.
</ul>
<p><b>1.3</b><ul>
<li> trio's treatment of the field width when the %e code was used was not
  correct (Gisli Ottarsson reported). It turns out the fraction part should
  be zero-padded by default and the exponent part should be zero-prefixed
  if it is only one digit. At least that's how the GNU and Sun libc's work.
  The trio floating point output looks identical to them now.
<li> Fixed group scanning with modifiers.
<li> Igor Zlatkovic
  Fixed compilation of dprintf, which uses read/write, for MSCC.
<li> Fixed various compilation problems on Digital Unix (mainly associated with
  va_list).
</ul>
<p><b>1.2</b><ul>
<li> Added autoconf integration. If compiled with HAVE_CONFIG_H the following
  happens. Firstly, <config.h> is included. Secondly, trio will only be
  compiled if WITH_TRIO is defined herein. Thirdly, if TRIO_REPLACE_STDIO is
  defined, only stdio functions that have not been detected by autoconf, i.e.
  those not defined by HAVE_PRINTF or similar, will be replaced by trio
  functions (suggested by Daniel Veillard).
<li> Fixed '%m.nf' output. Previously trio did not treat the width properly
  in all cases (reported by Gisli Ottarsson).
<li> Added explicit promotion for the scanfv family.
<li> Fixed more C++ compilation warnings.
</ul>
<p><b>1.1</b><ul>
<li> Added explicit promotion for the printfv familiy. A float must be
 specified by %hf.
<li> Fixed positionals for printfv (reported by Gisli Ottarsson).
<li> Fixed an integer to pointer conversion problem on the SGI MIPS C compiler
 (reported by Gisli Ottarsson).
<li> Fixed ANSI C++ warnings (type casting, and namespace is a reserved keyword).
<li> Added \n to all examples in the documentation to prevent confusion.
<li> Fixed StrSubstringMax
</ul>
<p><b>1.0</b><ul>
 <li> More documentation
 <li> Fixed C99 support
 <li> Improved NaN support
</ul>
<p><b>0.24</b><ul>
 <li> User-defined specifier with callback function
 <li> printfv: an argument array implementation
</ul>
<p><b>0.23</b><ul>
 <li> Added width to scanning of floating-point numbers.
 <li> Wrote more documentation on trio_printf.
 <li> Fixed problem with trailing zeroes after decimal-point.
</ul>
<p><b>0.22</b><ul>
 <li>
  Added LC_CTYPE locale dependent character class expressions to scan lists.
  Included are [:alnum:], [:alpha:], [:cntrl:], [:digit:], [:graph:],
  [:lower:], [:print:], [:punct:], [:space:], [:upper:], [:xdigit:]
 <li>
  Added C escapes to alternative string formatting and scanning.
 <li>
  Added StrSubstringMax.
 <li>
  Wrote a little more documentation.
 <li>
  Fixed scanf return values.
 <li>
  Fixed a sign error for non-ascii characters.
</ul>
<p>
 <b>0.21</b><ul>
 <li> Converted the documentation to TeX. With latex2man the documentation can
  automatically be converted into man pages.
 <li> Added trio_scanf, trio_vscanf, trio_fscanf, and trio_vfscanf.
 <li> Added trio_dprintf, trio_vdprintf, trio_dscanf, and trio_vdscanf. These
  functions can be used to write and read directly to pipes and sockets (the
  assume blocking sockets). Stdio buffering is surpassed, so the functions are
  async-safe. However, reading from stdin (STDIN_FILENO) or writing to stdout
  (STDOUT_FILENO) reintroduces the buffering.
 <li> Added trio_dprintf and trio_vdprintf. These can be used to write directly
  to pipes and sockets.
 <li> Paul Janzen
  Added trio_asprintf and trio_vasprintf, which are compatible with the GNU
  and BSD interfaces.
 <li> Added scanlist ranges for group scanning (%[]).
 <li> Added width for scanning (missing for floating-point numbers though).
 <li> Added variable size modifier (&) to handle system defined types of unknown
  size. This modifier makes certain assumptions about the integer sizes, which
  may not be valid on any machine. Consequently, the modifier will remain
  undocumented, as it may be removed later.
 <li> Added \777 and \xFF to alternative string scanning (%#s)
 <li> Added the TRIO_REPLACE_STDIO check in the header.
 <li> Improved performance of the multibyte character parsing.
 <li> Fixed positionals (%n$) which had stopped working.
 <li> Fixed hh and ll modifiers to allow exactly two letters and no more.
 <li> Fixed ANSI C++ warnings. Also fixed the compiler warning about casting
  between integer and pointer (this has been annoying me for ages).
 <li> Fixed snprintf and vsnprintf with zero buffer size.
 <li> Fixed NAN problems (reported by Keith Briggs).
 <li> Fixed parsing of multibyte characters. The format string was not correctly
  advanced in case of a multibyte character.
 <li> Renamed many of the internal functions to have more consistant names.
 <li> Removed the &lt;quote=c&gt; and &lt;fill=c&gt; modifiers. They are not really worth
  including. The other &lt;&gt; modifiers may disappear as well.
 </ul>
<p>
 <b>0.20</b><ul>
 <li> Sticky flag to allow reuse of modifiers
 <li> Double-dot notation for radix
 <li> Uses LC_NUMERIC grouping
 <li> Fixed parameters to use positional, ie. *n$, and to accept an arbitrary
      number
 <li> intmax_t and ptrdiff_t supported
 </ul>
<p>
 <b>0.19</b><ul>
 <li> Bjorn Reese rewrote the entire floating-point formatting function.
 <li> Changed the parsing of the format string to be multibyte aware.
 <li> Added INF, -INF, and NAN for floating-point numbers.
 <li> Fixed %#.9g -- alternative with precision.
 <li> Ken Gibson Fixed printing of negative hex numbers
 <li> Joerg Fixed convertion of non-ASCII characters
 </ul>
 <b>0.16</b><ul>
 <li> Danny Dulai noticed another difference to the standard printf(), when you
  used ("%.0f", 3.0) or ("%#.0f", 3.0). I think I corrected the problems and
  I added tests for these outputs to the regression test.
 <li> TrioFormat() is now available "publicly".
 </ul>
<p>
 <b>0.15</b><ul> <li>
 Danny Dulai fixed several problems with the floating point precision. The
 regression tests are updated to check for this and also some new test cases
 that 0.14 didn't handle well.
 </ul>
