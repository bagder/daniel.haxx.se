TITLE(Trio - portable and extendable printf and string functions)
<p>
  Trio is a fully matured and stable set of printf and string functions
  designed be used by applications with focus on portability or with the need
  for additional features that are not supported by standard stdio
  implementation.
<p>
  There are several cases where you may want to consider using trio:
 <ol>
    <li> Portability across heterogeneous platforms.
    <li> Embedded systems without stdio support.
    <li> Extendability of unsupported features.
    <li> Your native version doesn't do everything you need.
 </ol>
<p>

  When you write applications that must be portable to a wide range of
  platforms you often have to deal with inadequate implementations of the
  stdio library functions. Most notably is the lack of secure formatting
  functions, such as snprintf, or the lack of parameter reordering commonly
  used for the internationalization of applications, such as the &lt;num&gt;$
  modifier. Sometimes the feature you need is simply not present in stdio. So
  you end up spending much effort on determining which platforms supports
  what, and to write your own versions of various features. This is where trio
  can help you. Trio is a platform-independent implementation of the stdio
  printf and scanf functions and the string library functions.

<p>
  The functionality described in the stdio standards is a compromise, and does
  unfortunately not include a mechanism to extend the functionality for an
  individual application. Oftentimes an application has the need for an extra
  feature, and the application code can become much more clear and readable
  by using an extension mechanism. Trio supports a range of useful extensions
  such as user-defined specifiers, passing of arguments in arrays, localized
  string scanning, thousand-separators, and arbitrary integer bases.

<p>
  Trio fully implements the C99 (ISO/IEC 9899:1999) and UNIX98 (the Single
  Unix Specification, Version 2) standards, as well as many features from
  other implemenations, e.g. the GNU libc and BSD4.


#define NUM(x) <b><i>x</i></b> &middot;
<p>
<h2>Examples</h2>
<p>
 NUM(1) Output an integer as a binary number using a trio extension.
<pre>
    trio_printf("%..2i\n", number);
</pre>

<p>
 NUM(2) Output a number with thousand-separator using a trio extension
<pre>
    trio_printf("%'f\n", 12345.6);
</pre>
  The thousand-separator described by the locale is used.

<p>
 NUM(3) Output an fixed length array of floating-point numbers.
<pre>
    double array[] = {1.0, 2.0, 3.0};

    printf("%.2f %.2f %.2f\n", array[0], array[1], array[2]);
</pre>
  The same with two trio extensions (arguments are passed in an array, and
  the first formatting specifier sets the sticky option so we do not have
  to type all the formatting modifiers for the remaining formatting specifiers)
<pre>
    trio_printfv("%!.2f %f %f\n", array);
</pre>
  Another, and more powerful, application of being able to pass arguments
  in an array is the creation of the printf/scanf statement at run-time,
  where the formatting string, and thus the argument list, is based on an
  external configuration file.
<p>

 NUM(4) Parse a string consisting of one or more upper-case alphabetic
  characters followed by one or more numeric characters.
<pre>
    sscanf(buffer, "%[A-Z]%[0-9]", alphabetic, numeric);
</pre>
  The same but with locale using a trio extension.
<pre>
    trio_sscanf(buffer, "%[:upper:]%[:digit:]", alphabetic, numeric);
</pre>
