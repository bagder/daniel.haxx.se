TITLE(Home office)

<p>
I have been working from home exclusively since 2014. I do open source
development but also the occasional live-stream and webinar from this place. I
spend all work days here and often a few additional spare time hours later. I
never game.

<p>
My home office is on the upper floor of my house in a southern suburb of
Stockholm, Sweden.

<p>
The desk is a 300 cm wide, 60 cm deep home made design, created using a
kitchen countertop in oak with white table legs from IKEA. It is designed to
fit exactly between the doors in the wall immediately next to the table on
both sides. My original idea was to leave space to allow more than one person
to work at it.

<p>
A - Here are boxes from recent purchases and gifts that arrived. Not really
for my work benefit, but good to keep around for while before recycling in
case I need to return stuff or similar.
<p>
B - This is my old development machine that have not been "taken care of"
properly. The new, current machine I use, is in E.
<p>
C - An old loudspeaker from a long time ago for when I want sound. I often
just use headphones (to save my family from my sounds and let the noise
canceling save me from my family's sounds) so this is not used terribly
much. My wireless headphones (Bose Quiet Comfort 35) are not in this photo.
<p>
D - cable mess. I counted 29 used power plugs a while ago. After this photo
was taken I actually cleaned up the situation and the cables are now hidden in
clean white boxes.
<p>
E -
My <a href="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2023/02/20/my-2023-dev-machine/">current
work horse and development machine</a>. Runs Debian Unstable, with two 27 inch
4K screens.
<p>
F - backpacks. One for short stay-over trips and one I use for daytrips when I
do talks etc. They usually should not just be out on the floor like this, but
when I took this photo I had not done my job right.
<p>
G - my work laptop. It's a 14 inch lenono 540s running Debian Unstable. I
never work a lot from laptop but when I do this is my machine. It is light
enough to be easy to bring with me wherever I like. Not very powerful.
<p>
H - my headset. A light Sennheiser set with a cable for meetings, talks,
webinars etc.
<p>
I - A usb hub to provide a set of extra USB ports for when the ones in the PC
are not enough or not close enough.
<p>
J - <a href="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2014/08/20/the-right-keyboard-layout">Mechanical keyboard</a> with Cherry MX Red switches. I average at some 8
million key presses per year.
<p>
K - USB charger. A micro USB, USB-C and my fitfit cables are on the
table. Next to that is my ethernet to USB "dongle", as one of my laptops
doesn't have an RJ45.
<p>
L - Two extra computers: this is a Lenovo 13 on top that runs Windows, which I
use for video conferencing and the likes when those glitch or work
suboptimally on Linux. Underneath is one of my mac minis I use for curl
development when I need to work on macOS specific issues. This
is <a href="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2022/12/30/an-m1-for-curl/">the m1
version</a>. I also have an x86 version but that is not in this picture.
<p>
M - Extra temp screen and keyboard. Right now this set is attached to computer
(B) but I also use it for the ones in (L) when necessary. Depending on work.
<p>
N - Led light, for when I need extra bright lighting perhaps when doing video
conferences or streaming. (A gift from GitHub)
<p>
O - Kid drawings with curl theme. To keep my spirits up! The left one is from
my daughter from many years back and the right one is a more recent one from a
friend's daughter.
<p>
P - I have three of these spotlights to provide pleasent light during the dark
hours. The two ceiling windows do provide adequate and rather nice light for
the bright hours but I live in Sweden and we have extended periods of darkness
during winter...
<p>
Q - GitHub coasters. I need to put my coffee cup on something!

<p>
A - art work. A gift from curl's 20th birthday. It features 20 * 365 small
lines for every day curl had existed, but with a twitch: they also form the
big letter 'c' in a kind of subtle way.
<p>
B - a wooden robot that can be modified to stand or sit in different
positions.
<p>
C - a GitHub star logo led thing. Powered by USB and controlled with the
little remote that is on the table next to it. It can be set to different
colors and numerous different light patterns. From mildly disturbing to highly
annoying...
<p>
D - A wooden 3d puzzle thing in its solved shape. A gift from GitHub.
<p>
E - My Polhem Prize award. A gold medal. But in this picture there are two old
chocolate fake polhem prize awards lying on top of, hiding, the real medal.
<p>
F - A "korpen" medal I recevied a few years ago when my team won a floorball
tournament. Gold-colored plastic.
<p>
G - My <a href="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2021/08/11/a-github-star">GitHub star award</a>
<p>
H - ember mug, usb powered, app controlled. Keeps my coffee heated. To be
honest, I barely ever use it.
<p>
I - USB to RJ45 thingie for my silly left laptop without RJ45
