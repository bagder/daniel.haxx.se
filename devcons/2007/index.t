The webcam was really busy taking photos and here's the output from the pic
uploading script. The download server hosting the pics really peaked
bandwidth-wise during the weekend.

A very important part of any serious Rockbox gathering is of course the
building of the tower of Rockbox, and this time I dare to say that we made the
biggest one yet. Counting the bare bones PCBs and development targets, I
believe we exceeded 20 targets in the creation. Of course we cheated somewhat
since there's a 80GB 5.5G ipod in there, and it wasn't an actual target until
days after devcon... But there were several more targets present, so it
<i>could</i> have been made bigger.

Some devs woke early and eagerly dashed to the computer for some quick commits
before the other noticed... As seen here, the webcam wasn't even turned on!

 Jens uses the whiteboard to explain to the crowd how we can make the 32/64 MB
RAM detection for ipod videos so that we can have one united build for them.

 18-20 May, 2007

<p>
 We were a bit late with setting the date and thus announcing devcon this
year, and that of course made it hard for some devs to attend.

<p>
 I got this year's newly designed tshirts around 10am the morning devcon
started. Real life prevented me from attending from the first moments, so
Linus shouldered the responsibilities to pick people up when they came from
the airport and to setup the network facilities etc.

<p>
 As a little surprise this year, we also had Haxx sponsor us with a nice set
of Rockbox coffee cups - the blue ones you'll spot on photos from devcon.

<p>
 Like last year, we spent the weekend in the office of Contactor Data which
employs several of us Swedes. Access to meeting rooms, whiteboards and a fully
charged coffee machine!

<p>
 Jens and Marianne showed up around 14, they had the network and webcam up and
running around 16, Christi showed up at 18 and at 20 Marcoen arrived.

<p> I got to the devcon place at 21 a short while before Peter came. For some
 reason there was quite some talk on IRC about the beer he was gonna bring, so
 when we showed up we of course took a moment and got amazed by the nice
 collection he pulled out from his bag.

<p> We had two talk sessions, one on saturday and one on the sunday and we
 had a wide spectrum of topics to discuss. I would say we managed quite well.

<p> During the devcon we agreed that having a single huge devcon is better
than having two separate one like this year (one in Europe and one in the US),
so we now plan on making a greater effort to make a unified one 2008. We hope
to manage this by subsidizing tickets even more and <b>you can help</b> by
donating to us:
