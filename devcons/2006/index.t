<h1>Summary from Devcon2006</h1>
<table><tr valign="top"><td width="25%">

<p> It all started a friday afternoon. Linus and Daniel left work early and
 went shopping food and beers and then started setting up stuff in the
 conference place.

<p> We were located in Akalla, a northern suburb to Stockholm (Sweden), in the
 offices of Contactor Data (employer of a few Rockbox developers).

<p> The conference was truly international, with visitors coming in from
 Germany, Britain and USA.

<p> During the afternoon we got the network setup and we messed around a bit
 to get the webcam going and started publishing camshots updated every 5th
 second.

<p> Björn popped in at around 14:30

<p> Jens arrived at 15:30

<p> We unpacked the box with Rockbox shirts and made sure everyone got a shirt
 as soon as they arrived.

<p> The evening started calmly, with some gentle CVS commits and hacking.

<p> The webcam got very popular and quite a crowd did visit the devcon page
 and monitored the cam updates. In fact there were so many visitors the poor
 rockbox.org bandwidth struggled so much that at 20:39 Mikachu had kindly
 arranged a new hosting for the webcam pictures to offload the rockbox.org
 network.

<p> We checked the flight schedules of Brandon and Christi, as we knew they
 were gonna meet up at the airport. One of their flights was delayed, and
 quite amusingly when Christi called us with her cell phone Brandon appeared
 on IRC asking if we'd heared anything from her. We managed to guide them to
 the same spot...

<p> ... a few hours later, we started to get worried as Christi and Brandon
 had still not showed up at the conference place and they hadn't called...

<p> 21:00 - Linus took a drive with his car to see if he would find some lost
 souls wandering about in the cold. He didn't!

<p> 21:45 - We looked outside over at the Burger King place only to see their
 closing time. Ooops, they close at 22:00! Daniel ran out to go fetch us some
 food before they close. The others waiting in case someone would show up.

<p> 22:01 - When Daniel got back with a few bags with burgers and fries,
 Christi and Brandon arrived! They had only gotten off too late from the bus
 and then when trying to get the subway back they got off on the wrong
 station...

<p> Jörg arrived with an even later flight and Daniel picked him up and they
 got back to the place just before 23:00

<p>
 We started the first actual talk and conferencing on Saturday morning.

<p> Saturday 12:00 - Andreas appeared

<p> The rest of the event was lots of hacking, lots of talking, eating food,
 drinking beer, IRCing on #rockbox and we did go over the entire planned
 agenda and we did reach lots of good results and consensus.

<p> We even decided on a 3.0 release, including feature freeze and more!

<p> We ended the event on Sunday afternoon. We had a great time.

<p> The photos on this page were taken by Brandon, Jörg, Jens and Daniel.
