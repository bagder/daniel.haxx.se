  Another <a
href="http://www.rockbox.org/twiki/bin/view/Main/DevConEuro2008">devcon</a>
has taken place and yet again it was a happy occasion with lots of fun, lots
of talk and lots of targets.

<p> <a
href="http://picasaweb.google.com/peturbox/RockboxDevcon2008">pictures</a> and
<a href="http://www.dailymotion.com/group/RockboxDevcon2008">videos</a> from
the event taken by petur, and I also put together a <a
href="http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x5y9j1_devcon2007_tech">movie from the
still images taken during devcon 2007</a>.

<p>
 This year we gathered in Berlin Germany during 27-29th of June. We had the
conference at the company Jens is employed by and we slept at nearby
hotels. Everything worked great!

<p>
 The Rockbox fund paid for a lot of the food during the event (breakfasts and
dinners) and attendees will get travel expenses and hotels paid for, up to 200
Euros per person. As a sign of our appreciation of people showing up.

<p>
 <a href="http://www.rockbox.org/devcon2008/">The "official" 2008 devcon
page</a> includes links to recordings from the two discussion sessions we did,
both recorded with video and "plain" mp3 recordings.

<p> Thanks to the fun service of <a href="http://ustream.tv/">ustream.tv</a>,
we had a live-stream of the entire event broadcasted. Not that we're a lot of
fun to watch or anything, but it certainly gave us a certain feel of
"connection" with the guys who couldn't make it here and were hanging out on
IRC instead during the event. It also let us record the stream which allowed
everyone to experience the atmosphere of the talk sessions.

<p> We had 24 (!) different targets present that all could run Rockbox to
various degrees, and 9 potentional future targets:<br> <img

<br>
This picture also shows a collection of the fine beers we enjoyed.

<p>
 The art of building towers out of targets that "can display Rockbox" was taken to a new level with this:

The biggest Tower of Rockbox so far? 75cm, more than 1TB of storage.

<p>
 A big thanks to Jens and Marianne who worked as hosts for this great event!
