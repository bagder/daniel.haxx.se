TITLE(My name appears in products)

<img src="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/ios-credits.png" width="300" style="border: 1px solid black; margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px; float: right;">

<p> My name, <i>Daniel Stenberg</i>, and email address appear in many
 products. In license screens, about windows, credit sequences, author lists,
 third party software license collections and more. Like this example here on
 the right.

<p> My name appears in computer games, mobile phones, television sets, car
infotainment systems, software manuals, printer touch screens, device
documentation and printed on paper shipped in glossy cardboard boxes.

<p> My name shows up in all those places and many more for a very simple
reason. I write software they use.

<p> I write software that I give away for free for anyone to use. The users of
software I work on usually download, build and use my software components
without telling me and I often do not know who the users of my software are.

<p> You probably found my name in a product I never heard of, and I never had
any contact and never communicated with anyone on the team making that
product.

<p> My name often appears as part of the software license included with the
software I help author. The device or tool manufacturer then includes that
license text to adhere to the license conditions I have put on the
software. They get to use my software for free on the small and simple
condition that they inform the world that they are using my product.

<p> Yes, in many cases my name and my email address might be almost the only
one you can find or be the easiest one to use, but that is unfortunately
simply the fault of the people making the products.

<p> Products I helped create have been installed in billions of installations.
Pieces of my code run in virtually all Internet connected devices on the
globe.

<p> The main products that are used widely that might contain or lead to my
name include <a href="https://curl.se/">curl</a>, <a
href="https://c-ares.org/">c-ares</a> and <a
href="https://libssh2.org/">libssh2</a>.

SUBTITLE(I cannot help you)

<p> When you find my name in a product there is rarely any point in contacting
 me for help or to ask me for guidance with said product. Many <a
 href="/email/">people still email me</a>.

<p> I do not know that product. I do not know how to use, repair or operate
that product, device or tool.

<p> I was not involved in making the product. I do not know the people or the
company that made the product. Asking me is totally useless and simply
misdirected.

<p> I do not know the people nor the company. I cannot help you get in contact
with them.

<p> I wrote a software component they use. That is all.

SUBTITLE(I collect screenshotted credits)

<p> If you found my name or credits in a product screen somewhere, please know
that I collect <a
href="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2016/10/03/screenshotted-curl-credits/">screenshotted
curl/Daniel credits</a> on a dedicated page.

SUBTITLE(Questions about products I work on)

<p> If you have questions or need help about any of the products or projects I
 actually work on, then email your questions to the proper dedicated mailing
 lists or submit issues in their respective GitHub repositories.

<p> Please do not contact me privately for free support. I offer free support
in the public forums, and I offer private <a
href="https://curl.se/support.html">curl support for a fee</a>.
