SUBTITLE(How To Invite Me For a Talk)
BOXTOP

<p> I'm generally open for suggestions and invitations to speak. I've <a
 href="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2019/05/09/sometimes-i-speak/">talked in a
 dozen countries</a> to both huge and small audiences.

 Here's some guidelines to make it a smoother process with a higher likeliness
 of success and happy faces on all sides.

SUBTITLE(Scheduling)
<p>
 Ask well in advance (preferably more than 2-3 months, probably not more
 than 9). When I agree to a talk, others who ask for talks in close proximity
 to that date will get declined. I get a surprisingly large amount of
 invitations for events just a month into the future or so, and it rarely
 works for me to get those into my calendar in that time frame.
<p>
 By looking at my list of <a href="/talks.html">coming public talks</a> you can
 also get an initial clue of what dates that won't work.

SUBTITLE(Compensation)

<p> Do not assume that I can offer a for-free delivery - I still need food on
 the table and preparing, creating, traveling and delivering a good
 presentation takes serious time and efforts. Also, talking at a conference
 takes away developer time (which is what I actually do for a living).

<p> I will expect that you cover travel and lodging expenses. I don't require
 fancy, but it needs to be decent.

<p> I consider it good manners if you address the price/charge situation, if
 not in the first contact email at least in the following discussion. If you
 cannot pay a speaker's fee, thatâ€™s vital information to provide early as it
 is usually a blocker.

SUBTITLE(About the specific talk)

<p> What's the ideal/planned duration of my talk? Between 30 - 60 minutes is
 normal.

<p> I'm bilingual. I speak fluent English and Swedish. If you say nothing
 else, I will presume you want the talk in English.

<p> Surprisingly often I get invited to talk without a specified topic or
 title. The inviter then expects me to provide that. Since you contact me you
 clearly had some kind of vision of what a talk by me would entail, it would
 make my life easier if that vision was forwarded to help me produce a talk
 subject that will work!

SUBTITLE(About the occasion)

<p> Do not assume I know about your conference or the venue. Tell me a little!

<p> I <i>strongly</i> prefer to bring my own laptop with a prepared slide
 deck. Please don't require me to hand over the slides to you in some fixed
 pre-determined format (to which my slides need to be converted to and thus
 causing me extra work). Further, I rarely have my presentation deck "done"
 until the last minute as I like to keep polishing.

<p> Make sure your projector can do 16:9 screen ratio or tell me in advance.
