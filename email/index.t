TITLE(The Daniel email collection)
<p>
This is a collection of emails I have received over the years. I have tried to
remove all names, email addresses and some company names.
<p>
Except the redaction of personal identifiable information, the contents of the
emails are shown exactly as I received them.
<p>
The emails tend to be in one of these categories.
<ul>
<li> Accusing me of wrongdoings

<li> Thinking I'm responsible for or know anything about a product (that
  probably uses curl)

<li> Random weirdness
</ul>

<p> To the best of my knowledge, none of these emails were sent ironically or
as jokes.

<p> This is a subset of the total feed. A curated "best of".

SUBTITLE(The emails)
<p> <a href="2009-03-21.html">start here</a>, <a href="2017-09-20.html">here</a> or
<a href="2020-03-21.html">here</a>.

<p>
Or go to the <a href="toc.html">index of all emails</a>

SUBTITLE(Why do I get these emails?)
<p> <a href="/my-name-in-products.html">My name appears in many products.</a>.

SUBTITLE(Do I respond?)
<p>
I used to. Over time I learned that is very hard to bridge the knowledge gap,
plus the fact that many users will just consider whatever I say as excuses for
not helping them the way they want.
<p>
It simply takes too much time and energy. I almost never respond to these
emails anymore.
