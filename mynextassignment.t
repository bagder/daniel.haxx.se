TITLE(What I look for in my next assignment)
BOXTOP

SUBTITLE(Tech)
<p>
 I want to work with and be close to technology, preferably of course
technology that is leading or innovating. I'm an embedded engineer since
forever and what I do is always near hardware or at least near the operating
system level.

<p>
 There should be a decent amount of Linux and/or other open source involved.

SUBTITLE(Consultant not employee)
<p>
 I'm not interested in employment offers. I can do long-term assignments, but
I'm employed by Haxx AB. Once I've joined a project that is what I work for
and it will get my attention and loyalty.

<p>
 I'm not cheap. If you're looking for a low-rate consultant, I'm not your
match. With me, you get what you pay for!

SUBTITLE(Location)
<p>
 I live just south of Stockholm, in Huddinge. I can accept assignments in
remote locations as long as I don't have to travel there very frequently. I
also appreciate jobs where I can work from home every now and then to reduce
commuting time.

SUBTITLE(Role)
<p>
 I'm a professional software engineer with over 20 years experience of
embedded systems, embedded Linux, networking, open source and more in more
than 30 projects as consultant. I want a role where my expertise can be taken
advantage of and where I am appreciated for what I bring.

<p>
 I'm a developer at heart with a strong knowledge of tech, but I'm also used
to technical lead roles, software design/architecture and product
management. I'm used to roles where I occasionally face my customer's
customers and I frequently represent my customer with the style and
professionalism it requires. I've also done so on numerous occasions in face
to face meetings, including in foreign countries with other work cultures. I'm
used to mixing Swedish and English as work language, or using either one
exclusively.

<p>
 I love a good challenge, to learn new stuff and to get on the verge of and
beyond my comfort zone.

SUBTITLE(Development language)
<p>
 I'm a low-level developer and engineer. For development, I work where C is
almost exclusively always the best and default choice. Sure I can do C++ and
certainly I do script languages where necessary and to batch or higher level
stuff, but I'm a C developer at heart. I want to work with or at least close
development.

SUBTITLE(Team)
<p>
 I'm used to working with teams of all sorts of sizes and constructs. I've
worked in many places where various parts of the development team have been
distributed to other parts of the world. I'm used to doing video and phone
conferencing as part of the daily routine to keep in touch and synchronize
development.  I've worked with all sorts of developments processes over the
years as their names and popularities come and go over time. I adapt.

SUBTITLE(Company / Industry)
<p>
 I've worked for single-digit employee companies up to 100,000 employee
companies. I don't mind the size, I care about the particular of the
project/assignment. It also doesn't matter if the company works with
furniture, cameras, RFID, ATMs, Linux distributions and what not. There are
interesting projects in all industries!

SUBTITLE(Previous customers and assignments)

<p>
 The last 10 - 15 years of assignments and experiences are detailed in my CV
(<a href="/cv/Daniel%20Stenberg-Haxx-English.pdf">English</a> and <a
href="/cv/Daniel%20Stenberg-Haxx.pdf">Swedish</a>).
