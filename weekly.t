TITLE(daniel weekly)

<p>

 Daniel Weekly is a series of 10-20 minutes video clips. In each episode I
talk about things that are near and dear to me: the subjects include curl,
Firefox, HTTP, HTTP/2, internet protocols in general, open source stuff and
other projects I am involved in.

<p>
 I aim to record one show every week, usually on wednesdays. Episode one was recorded on September 8, 2014.
