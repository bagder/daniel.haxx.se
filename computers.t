TITLE(Compuiter history)
BOXTOP

<p> Before 1985, I had to play around with the computers of my friends. I
 think it is fair to say that my life took a different turn 1985, with that
 first computer...

<p> This list only contains the computers I've personally used in my home. It
does not include computers for the household or those used by other family
members.

<ul>
 <li> <b>1985, Spring</b> - I and my brother Bj√∂rn bought a C64 together. We
      immediately started hacking BASIC on the thing and in the end of 1987 I
      wrote my first 6510 assembler demos. More stories from our adventures with
      the C64 are told on <a href="http://kjell.haxx.se/horizon/">Kjell's
      Horizon page</a>.
 <li> <b>1990</b> - Amiga 500. We initially wrote some assembler and fiddled
      with demos. Without the narrow limits of the kind the C64 offered, it
      proved not as thrilling and we skipped over to system programming in C.
      We started writing on our text editor FrexxEd.
 <li> <b>1992</b> - Amiga 3000. The good old 500 got a little too slow and it
      took ages to compile and build FrexxEd on it. The 3000 with its blazing
      speed (25Mhz 68030) took us to new levels! When I subsequently bought a
      graphic card for it, I could even run 1152x900 with 8bit colors!

 <li> <b>1997</b> - Desktop: Intel Pentium 120Mhz. While this machine mainly
      ran Windows 95, its prime use was to run an X server so that I could
      connect to my work computers and hack unix on X from home. The Amiga was
      put to the side.

 <li> <b>2000</b> - Desktop: Intel Pentium III 733 Mhz. Linux, first and
      primarily. With my 21" CRT screen (Nokia 445PRO) it made a neat
      environment.

 <li> <b>2002</b> - Laptop: A 600MHz celeron box with 96MB ram, running Redhat
      Linux 7.3.

 <li> <b>2004</b> - Desktop: AMD Athlon XP 2800 2053 Mhz ASUS A7V8X-X
      motherboard. 512MB RAM, 200GB disk. Linux, Debian. Wireless D-Link PCI
      card 802.11g. No more noisy box.

 <li> <b>2006, December</b> - Laptop: <a href="/f3ja/">ASUS F3JA</a>, 1.8GHz
      dual core (Intel Core 2 Duo T5600), 120GB sata-disk, 1680x050 15.4"
      LCD. Intel 3945ABG chipset. Dualboot Windows/Linux.

 <li> <b>2007, April</b> - Desktop: AMD Athlon 64 X2 5600+ (2.8GHz), 4GB RAM
      (PC2-6400 800MHz), 2 x 500GB SATA disks. Asus M2NPV-MX GF6150
      Motherboard, Zalman CNPS9500AM2 Fan.  D-Link DWL-G520 Wireless PCI
      Adapter. Creative Sound Blaster PCI since Linux has no audio support for
      the on-board stuff. Using a DELL 2001FP 20" 1600x1200 LCD screen.

 <li> <b>2009, May</b> - Netbook: Asus EeePC S101, 10.1" 2GB RAM, 16GB SSD +
      32GB SDHC card.

 <li> <b>2009</b> - upgraded desktop to 24" Benq 1920x1200, inserted a ATI
      Radeon X300SE graphics card since the Nvidia open source driver doesn't
      deal with this resolution

 <li> <b>2012, September</b> - Desktop: Intel Core-i7 3770K, 3.5GHz, 16GB RAM, 256GM SSD, 3TB HDD.
      P8Z77-I Motherboard. <a href="http://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2012/11/20/say-hello-to-moo/">More details</a>
