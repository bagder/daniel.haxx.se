TITLE(The Million Download Sites Dilemma)
BOXTOP

<p> I write software. Lots of software. I make a lot of software available,
 online, with sources, for free. I spend many spare time hours doing this.

<p> I usually post information about software updates to a few sites I know
 are good sites to post on, sites I know my "audience" is visiting so that
 they get to know about my new releases. There are also a few site admins that
 subscribe to my announcement mailing lists or that poll the necessary web
 pages automatically to detect when I release new stuff.

<p> They are all nice, good, fine and important for my software to reach my
 audience, the users of my software.

<p> Nowadays, I get emailed almost on a daily basis by administrators that
 open up new sites, or run an old site and they just fell over my email
 address somewhere (very often I guess because they found another download
 site with my software on it). They want me to post, update and publish my
 stuff over at their site(s). (For some reason, these sites are almost always
 devoted to Windows-only programs) They all have millions of visitors (so they
 say), they all offer many many new users of my software and very often they
 do banner advertising or even are selling CDs with free software on.

<p> They want to sit there relaxing, while the authors themselves update their
 sites, so that they get visitors and get money and whatever. What do I get?
 Let's say that some of their promises are met and I get more users of my 100%
 free software. Why would I sweat a lot for that? If I were to give just a
 fraction of all those sites my attention and post updates to them, it would
 become next to a full-time job. I wouldn't even know which ones I should go
 with and which that are bad (as I'm sure there are gems hidden among them),
 they're just too many too similar too boring.

<p> No, I won't update my software information in your software index site.
 There's no point in me doing that. <b>Feel free to update the information
 yourself, subscribe to our announcement mailing list or just grab whatever
 info there's lying around on the web site.</b> I'll appreciate it a lot if
 you do.

<p> Really good free software gets spread, discussed and used no matter what I
 do or not. If people find the software useful and good, they'll use it,
 spread the word and distribute the release archives. They'll recommend it to
 friends and tell others in discussion forums.

<p> I can't see the point in me advertising my software on more download
 sites.
